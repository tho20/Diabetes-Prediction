# Diabetes-Prediction
Given different features about a person, predict wether the person has diabetes.

### Choice of Model: SVM (Support vector machine)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes of data points, which are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. SVM can handle both linear and nonlinear classification problems by mapping the input data into a higher-dimensional space through a kernel function. SVMs are widely used in various fields, such as bioinformatics, finance, and image recognition, due to their high accuracy and good generalization performance. SVMs can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the kernel function and regularization parameter, which should be carefully tuned to achieve the best performance.

Use cases:

1. When the data is high-dimensional and has a clear separation between the classes: SVMs work well in high-dimensional spaces and can find the best hyperplane to separate the data into classes.

2. When the number of samples is smaller than the number of features: SVMs can handle this situation by using the kernel trick to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where the classes are better separated.

3. When there is a need for good generalization performance: SVMs aim to maximize the margin between the classes, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

4. When the data is nonlinearly separable: SVMs can use a nonlinear kernel function to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where it's easier to separate the classes.

5. When the classes are imbalanced: SVMs can use different types of kernels and loss functions to handle imbalanced classes, such as the weighted SVM and the cost-sensitive SVM.
